**Kountdown** is an IRC bot created to, well, Count down to rocket launches and other aerospace-related events that are worth following. It resides in the channels #KSPOfficial and #kspmodders on irc.esper.net. 

The bot is based on the awesome Willie bot framework and as such also benefits from lots of awesome features the base bot has. The primary difference is a couple custom modules that manage countdowns and provide handy search commands.

This repo is going to contain just those modules, which are basically everything you need to make your own perfect copy of the bot minus a config.

Right now I think the code I have is too crude and ugly to show to anyone and created the repo primarily for the issue tracker, which enables users to submit feature requests (and bug reports) that don't go anywhere and also gives me a good place to store my TODO's (as I tend to forget a lot of stuff, especially stuff someone asks me to do :P)
