**Kountdown** is an IRC bot created to, well, Count down to rocket launches and other aerospace-related events that are worth following. It resides in the channels #KSPOfficial and #kspmodders on irc.esper.net. 

The bot is based on the awesome [Willie](http://github.com/embolalia/willie) bot framework and as such also benefits from lots of awesome features the base bot has. The primary difference is a couple custom modules that manage countdowns and provide handy search commands and then another couple of modules which are the default url and yt with a hacked-in option to disable automatic URL titles.

This repo is going to contain just those modules, which are basically everything you need to make your own perfect copy of the bot... ~~Maybe.~~

Right now I think the code I have is too crude and ugly to show to anyone and created the repo primarily for the ~~lulz~~ issue tracker, which enables users to submit feature requests (and bug reports) that don't get lost immediately while simultaneously giving me a good place to store my TODO's (as I tend to forget a lot of stuff, especially stuff someone else wants :P)

So if you have ~~a trollpost to post~~ an idea to suggest, please do! The tracker is over there. ———>
